********* Working with Refs & Portals *********

Refs: 
    -it is like a useState only.
    -it preserve the value.
    -no rerender.
    -whenever the ref changes, the components function does't re-execute.


**useState VS useRef:

*For useState:

-Allows functional components to have their own state.
-Allows us to update the state inside components.
-It causes components to re-render after state updates.
-Returns the current state.
-Has an updater function that updates the state.


*For useRef:

-Returns an object with a property containing the initial value.
-Doesn't cause a component to re-render when the value or state changes.
-Data is persisted between renders.
-Allows referencing DOM elements.
